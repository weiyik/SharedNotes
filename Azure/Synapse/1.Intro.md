# Understanding Synapse Analytics

* Synapse Analytics includes
  * Data Lake
  * SQL Data Warehouse: cloud-based EDW uses MPP to run complex queries on large data
  * Azure Analytics
* When to use
  * OLTP --historical data-> OLAP
  * compute resoueces independent from storeage resouces
* MPP - Massive Parallel Processing
  * Control Node
  * Compute Node
  * Storage Node
  * Data Warehouse Unit(DWU)
  * Data Movement Service(DMS)
* Data Distribution
  * a distribution is a basic unit of storage and processing for parallel quries
  * types:
    * replicated tables: caches a full copy on each compute node
      * good fit for small-dinension table in star schema
    * round robin(default): distributes data evenly across the table randomly
      * good fit for temporary staging table, and no obvious joining key or good candidate column
    * hash-distributed table: a hash function to assign each row to one distribution deterministically
      * good fit for fact tables, large dimension tables
* Partitions
  * usually partitioned on date
  * Table partition types
    * clustered columnstore
    * clustered index
    * heap
  * Sizing partitions
    * 10 to a few hundrred partitions
    * before partitinons are created, SQL data warehouse already divides each table into 60 distributed databases
