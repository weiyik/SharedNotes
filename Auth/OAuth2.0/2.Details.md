# OAuth in Detail

Each authorization grant types and when to use it

Different ways to receive response data as a client

* Protocal Endpoints
  * Authorization
  * Token
* OAuth Scope
  * like a entitlement model, like "rule_api.read"
* The Autorization Code Grant Type
  * Desined for "confidential clients", like server backend who can keep a secret
  * Explicit user & client app authentication
    * User need to authenicate
    * Client app need swap authorization grant code for access token
  * Demo:
    1. Authorization Request
       * `https://auth.abc.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=12345&redirect_uri=https://client.abc.com/callback&state=xyz&scope=rule_api.read&response_mode=query`
       * **response_type=code** means we're using Autorization Code Grant Type
       * **state=xyz** The state parameter should be included in response, as a round trip message. This is used to validate response is intended for us and avoid cross site request forgery. The value of the state must not be guessable to 3rd party.
       * **response_mode=query** means the state should be returned in the url query parameters when redirect
    2. Authorization Response
       * Once above auth success, auth server should redirect to the callback uri
       * `https://client.abc.com/callback?code=ABCDEFG12345xxxx&state=xyz`
       * **code** is the authorization code, it bounded to the user and the scope
       * **state** has to be the same as the state in request
    3. Token Request (This should be executed on secure backend server)
       * POST /token HTTP/1.1
       * Headers:
         * Host: server.abc.com
         * Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded    (encoded)
         * Authorization: Bacic asdfasfasdfasdfaffa
       * Body:
         * `grant_type=authorization_code&code=ABCDEFG12345xxxx&redirect_uri=https://client.abc.com/abc`
    4. Token Response
       * HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       * header: Content-Type=application/json
       * Body, in JSON
         * "access_token": "a1b2c3xxxxxxx"
         * "token_type": "Bearer"
         * "expires_in": 3600
         * "scope": "rule_api.read"
    5. Client app call API to get resource with access token, on behalf of user
       * In header, Bearer a1b2c3xxxxxxx
* The Implicit Grant Type [NOT RECOMMENDED]
  * Designed for public clients, who cannot keep a secret. e.g. single page app, js app
  * Client app access resource directly from browser
  * No explicit client app authentication with this type
  * This one is less secure then above Autorization Code Grant Type
  * When user authenticate and consent, directy get access token from authorization server
  * Since brower cannot keep a secret anyway, there's no need to send an extra HTTP call to swap auth code for access token.
  * In Authorization Request, **response_type=token**
  * Then in response, **access_token=a1b2c3xxxxxxx**
  * Security Concerns
    * access token exposed to resource owner(user)
    * access token accessible to 3rd party js
    * cannot validate the access token is intended for client app.
    * recommend to not use implict flow, instead, use CORS + PKCE
