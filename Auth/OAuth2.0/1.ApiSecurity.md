# API Security 101

Past  | Present
------------- | -------------
XML  | JSON
SOAP | HTTP APIs
SAML or WS | OAuth & OpenID Connect

---

* Senario
  * Allow an app to access an API on a user's behalf
* Solutions
  * Credential Sharing Problem:
    * app is impersonating the user, cannot control access
    * hard to revoke
    * risk of exposing user credential
  * Cookies Problem:
    * Cross-Site Request Forgery, CSRF
    * The cookie actually authroized the browser, not only a page
  * API Keys Problem:
    * Incompatibility: some application cannot keep a secret, e.g. a single page app
    * No standards
    * Expiration
* OAuth 2.0
  * Authorization framework
  * Built for HTTP APIs
  * Scoped access
  * Delegation Protocals
  * Players
    * Protected resource (HTTP API)
    * Client(requesting app): want to access protected resource on someone's behalf
    * Resouce Owner(the user)
    * Authorization Server: trusted by all parties involved
  * How it works
    1. Authorization Request (client -> resource owner)
    2. Authentication and Consent (resource owner <-> authorization server)
    3. Authorization Grant (client <- resource owner)
    4. Authorization Grant (client -> authorization server)
    5. Access Token (client <- authorization server)
    6. Request with token (client -> protected resource)
    7. protected resource validate token either inside itself or ask auth server
    8. Response (client <- protected resource)
  * What OAuth got very right
    * Delated access
    * API access control
    * Seperation of user & client credentials
    * User consent
