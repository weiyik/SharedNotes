Gradle is built on tasks, and it run tasks for us.

Build Phases

1. Initialzation
2. Configuration
3. Execution
   1. doFirst
   2. doLast

Task Dependency

```groovy
task hello {

}
task world {
    dependsOn hello
}
```
When we run `gradle world`, it will run `hello` first, then `world` task

Plugins provide tasks

```groovy
plugins { 
    id 'java' // common plugin
    id "com.example.tool" version "6.2.3" // community plugin
}
```
