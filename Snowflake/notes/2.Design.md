# Design

* Architecture
  * massive parallel processing db engine
  * Decouple compute an storage
  * Tight integration with cloud storage
* Virtual Warehouse
  * automatically start vw when it's needed\
  * multi-cluster warehouse: automatically scale when many many end users waiting 
* Database Objects
  * Tables
    * Permannent
    * Temporary - close when session closed
    * Transient, just like permanent, but withous fail-safe
    * External
  * Table Storage
    * Micro-partition
      * Automatic partitioning scheme
      * 50MB -500MB
      * Compressed columnar storage
      * Pruned(修剪) during query execution, based on metadata
    * Clustering keys (optional)
      * table 1TB +
      * Order the micro-partition records based on key
      * automatically maintained by snowflake
      * useful for rage and equality predicates on the key
    * Search Optimization Service (Enterprise edition)
      * Serverless
      * Table-level  property
      * Applies to equlity predicates
    * Constraints
      * Primary key
      * unique key
      * foreigh key
      * not null (enforced)
      * Not enfored: only for duocumenting and know how to interprete. Will not throw error even violated.
    * Data Types
      * Normal: Numeric, String&Banary, Date&Time, Boolean
      * Semi-structred: Variant, Array, Object
      * Spatial: Geography
    * Views
      * Normal, like in RDBMS
      * Secure, protect data, isolation between view definition and records
      * Materialized (enterprise edition)
    * Code modules
      * udf
      * External functions, remote API
      * Stored procedure, like RDBMS
