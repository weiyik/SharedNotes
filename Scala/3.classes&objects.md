# Scala Classes and Objeccts

## Classes and Methods

* Inheritence, abstract class, `override`
* Final class
* Companion object
  * same name as class, `class A`, `object A`
  * static methods, values
  * `apply` method, construct object, then don't need `new` keyword in code when creating object
* Implicit conversion
  * In the companion object, define method like `implicit def stringToCurrency(s: String): Currency = ???`
  * Then scala will implicitly convert string to `Currency` object if needed. `val cur: Currency = "100 CNY"`

## Traits

* trait can have field declaration and values, method declaration and implementation
* Declaring trait as self-type
  * As shown in example code below, `Address` declares `this: User =>`, then it can only be implemented by classes of `User` type. Meanwhile, it can access `User`'s member

```scala
trait User {
  val _name: String
}
trait Address {
  this: User =>
  var _street: String
  def printAddr(): Unit = {
    println(s"${_name}'s addr is ${_street}")
  }
}
class Customer(name: String, street: String) extends User with Address {
  override var _street = street
  override val _name = name
}
```

* Stackable modifications
  * from right to left
  * `class A extends B with C with D`
  * My questions: this seems to be error prone and confusing. When and why to use it?

## Case Class

### Built-in

* no need for `new` keyword when create object
* immutable
* `==` default equals on values
* hashcode
* toString
* copy and overwrite
  
```scala
case class Person(name: String, birthDate: LocalDate)
val p1 = Person("Alen", LocalDate.of(1999, 1, 1))
val p2 = Person("Alen", LocalDate.of(1999, 1, 1))
p1 == p2 // true
val p3 = p1.copy(name = "Alan") // Person(Alan,1999-01-01)
```

### Pattern Matching

unapply the constructor

```scala
p1 match {
  case Person(name, _) if name.startsWith("A") => println(name)
}
```

### Sealed Traits

like `enum`

```scala
sealed trait Status
case object Pending extends Status
case object Started extends Status
case object Terminated extends Status
val status: Status = Pending
status match {
  case Pending => println(Pending)
  case Started => println(Started)
  case Terminated => println(Terminated)
}
```



## Packaging and Importing

* package object, then it's accessible in current package, and could be accessed by other package once imported

```scala
package com.sample
package object hello {
    def sayHello() = println("Hello")
}
```
