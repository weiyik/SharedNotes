# Trouble with Distributed Systems

## Faults and Partial Failures

### Cloud computing and supercomputing

## Unreliable Networks

### Network Faults in Practice

### Detecting Faults

### Timeouts and Unbounded Delays

### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Networks

## Unreliable Clocks

### Monotonic vs. Time-of-Day Clocks

### Clock Synchronization and Accuracy

### Relying on Synchronous Clocks

* Timestamp for ordering events
* Clock readings ahve a confidence interval
* Syncronized clocks for global snapshots

### Process Pauses

## Knowledge, Truth, and Lies

### The Truth is defined by the majority

### Byzantine Faults

### System Model and Reality
