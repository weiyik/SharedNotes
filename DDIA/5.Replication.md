## Part II. Distributed Data
Why?
* Scalability
* Fault tolerance/High availability
* Latency

Scaling to Higher Load
* Vertically scaling / scaling up
  * shared-memory architecture
    * cost grows faster than linearly
    * fault tolerance and single geographic location
  * shared-disk architecture
    * fast network, usually used in data warehousing workloads
    * contention and overhead of locking limit scalability
* Shared-Nothing Arthictectures
  * node, software coordination, convventional network
  * Advantages
    * best price/performance ration
    * distribute data across multiple geographic regions, latency, HA
  * Complexity
* Replication vs Partitionning
  * Replication
    * same data on diff nodes, redundancy, improve performance
  * Partitionning
    * subsets of data on diff nodes

## Chapter 5. Replication
* Intro
  * Difficulty: Handling changes to replicated data
  * 3 popular algo
    * single-leader
    * multi-leader
    * leaderless
  * trade-offs, e.g.
    * whether to use synchronous or asynchronous replication
    * how to handle failed replicas
* Leaders and Followers
  * Intro
    * Q: how the data ends up to be on the all replicas?
    * The most common soltion: leader-based replication, aka, active/passive or master-slave replication
      1. One replica is leader. Clients write to leader
      2. Other replicas are followers. When leader have new data, it sends data changes to all followers as *replication* log or *change stream*.
      3. Clients read from any replica, but only write to the leader
    * Used on: 
      * RDBMS: PostgreSQL, MySQL, ... 
      * NoSQL: MongoDB, Rethink, Espresso
      * Message brokers: Kafka, RabbitMQ HA Queue
  * Syncronous vs Asynchronous Replication
    * always configurable in RDBMS, and hardcoded in other systems
    * advantage of syncronous replication: guaranteed to have up-to-date copy on followers, if leader suddenly fails
    * disadvantage of syncronous replication: if sync follower no respond, have to block all writes, and wait until the sync replica is available again.
    * Semi-synchronous Config. In practice, if enable sync replication in DBMS, it usually means one of the followers is sync, and others are async. If sync one are down or slow, one of the async can become sync. At least 2 nodes have up-to-date copy of data
  * Setting up new followers
    1. take snapshot, copy snap shot to new follower
    2. follower request data changes after the snapshot, process them. Then, we call it caught up.
  * Node Outage
    * follower failure: catch-up recovery
    * leader failure: failover (节点切换)
      * Steps of failover
        1. 确认leader失效: 心跳，超时
        2. Choosing new leader: 1) election 2) assigned by controller
        3. Reconfigure the system to use the new leader
      * Things can go wrong
        * if async replication, new leader may not have the latest data. If older leader comes back, 数据可能有冲突，这部分数据可能被丢弃。违背持久化的承诺，duribility
        * 当多系统协作时，丢弃数据是危险的。可能导致私有数据泄露。
        * split brain: 两个节点都认为自己是leader. 数据可能被破坏
        * proper timeout before failover? longer downtime v.s. unnecessary failovers
  * Implementation of Replication Logs
    * Statement-based Replication
      * leader log the request, and sends them to followers. Followers execute that request.
      * Problems:
        * nonderterministic function, like rand()
        * auto-incrementing columns, or request depending on current data in db, order matters.
        * Used on: MySQL 5.1-
    * Write-ahead Log (WAL) Shipping
      * log is an append-only sequence of bytes
      * leader send the log to follower, and follower process the log to build exact the same data
      * Disvantage: low level, coupled to storage engine. Weak compatibility btw diff versions of leader and follower
      * Used on: PostgreSQL, Oracle
    * Logical(Row-based) Log Replication
      * for RDBMS, logical log are records describing writes to db tables at row granularity
      * a transaction generate several records, followed by a record indicating the transactionwas commited. MySQL's binlog
      * Advantages:
        * decoupled from storage engine. easier to keep backward compatibility.
        * easier to parsed by external apps.
    * Trigger-based replication
      * flexibility, triggers and stored procedures
* Problems with Replication Lag
  * Reading Your Own Writes
    * Problem desc: user write to leader; user read from follower before data is synced; user seems to lose the data he just submitted.
    * Possible solutions:
      1. read from leader, for sth could be modified, for example, user's own profile. Still read other data from followers, e.g. others' profiles
      2. track the last update time of client. For one minute after the last update, read from reader. Or, montor the replication lag on followers, and prevent querying from followers falls one minte behind.
      3. client send request with its last udpate time, system can forward this request to newer replica if current replica is old. BUT: clock sync is a problem
    * Problems: 
      * replica across multiple datacenters, latency
      * multiple client for same user, (cross-device read-after-write consistency)
  * Monotonic Reads
    * Problem desc: A user first reads from a fresh replica, then from a stale replica. Time appeas to go backwards.
    * one solution: each user always read from the same replica
  * Consistent Prefix Reads
    * Problem desc: If some partition are replicated slower than others, an observer may see the answer before the question. (answer depends on question, update depends on insert)
    * One solution is to make usre writes with causal relation are written to the same partition, but in some apps this is not efficient.
  * Solutions for Replication Lag
    * Think, how your app behave if lag increased to minutes or hours?
      * If there's problem, then you need stronger guuuarantee
    * Transaction. -> Chapter 7 and 9
* Multi-Leader Replication
  * Use cases for multi-leader replication
  * Handing write conflicts
  * Multi-leader replication topologies
* Leaderless Replication
  * Writing to the DB when a node is down
  * Limitation of Quorum Consistency
  * Sloppy Quorums and Hinted Handoff
  * Detecting Concurrent Writes
* Summary
  * Purposes of replication:
    * High availability: system running when some servers and data centers down
    * Disconnected operation: allow app work when network interrupted
    * Latency: data close to user
    * Scalability: high volumn
  * Main approaches:
    * Single-leader replication
      * Write to leader. Read from followers, value might be stale
    * Multi-leader replication
      * Write to one of the leaders.
    * Leaderless replication
      * Write to several nodes, read from several nodes in parallel. w+r>n
  * Consistency models, handling replication lag:
    * Read-after-write consistency
      * users see data write by themselves
    * Monotonic reads
      * after users see data at one point in time, they shouldn't later see the data from ealier point in time
    * Consistent prefix reads
      * Users should see the data in a state that makes causal sense, 因果关系
  * Concurrency issue
    * conflict
