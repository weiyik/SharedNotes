## The Slippery Concept of a Transaction

### The Meaning of ACID

* BASE(not ACID): Basiscally Available, Soft state, Eventually consistency
* Atomicity
  * The ability to abort a transaction on error and have all wwrite from that transaction discarded. abortability
* Consistency
  * Some statement of you data that must always be true. Application's responsibility
  * C doen't really belongs to ACID
* Isolation
  * concurrently executing transactions are isolcated from each other.
  * serializability: db ensures that when all transactions committed, the result is the same as if they had run serially.
* Durability
  * promise that once a transaction has committed successfully, any data it has written will not be forgotten.

### Single-Object and Multi-Object Operations

## Weak Isolation Levels

### Read Commited

### Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Read

### Preventing Lost Updates

### Write Skew and Phantoms

## Serializability

### Actual Serial Execution

### Two-Phase Locking (2PL)

### Serializable Snapshots Isolation (SSI)
